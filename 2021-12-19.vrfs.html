**VRFs - what are they and how do they work in Symbol**

This article is split into three parts:
 1. background on HMACs - keyed-hash message authentication codes, if you're familiar with the topic, you can skip to next part
 2. VRFs - Verifiable Random Functions
 3. VRFs in Symbol

 Reader is expected to know following basic crypto terms:
 * [(cryptographic) hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)
 * [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
 * [shared secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret) i.e. using [Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange)


# HMACs - keyed-hash message authentication codes

HMAC is a general construction that allows turning any hash function into keyed hashing function that can be used for message authentication.
That all sounds fancy, so time to split it into digestible pieces[^hmac]:
 * _keyed hashing function_ means that the function takes two arguments, one is a _key_ and since the function does hashing the other argument is a message, therefore $ \text{HMAC}(\textit{key}, \textit{message}) $ ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkTteeu9Y.png)

 * _message authentication_ means that:
   * _message_ has not been modified in transport and
   * receiver can verify source of the message

Wait, receiver, where did he come from? Glad you ask.

 1. HMAC is not used on its own it's appended to a message send between **two** parties.
 2. The key isn't some random key, it's a _shared secret_, that is known to both parties (and only if the secret is known only to both parties, hmac provides message authentication).

# Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)

In case of HMAC only parties that _share a secret_ can calculate hmac value.

VRF is also _keyed hash_ but based on public-key cryptography. What this means is that:
 * only private key owner can calculate VRF hash.
 * everyone who has public key can validate such hash.

Owner of the private key is usually called a prover. Besides VRF hash, prover provides a proof, that the hash is valid.

Before diving in, it's crucial to understand the elements.

Prover calculates:

```text
proof = VRF_prove(secret_key, message)
hash  = VRF_hashing(proof)
```

Note, that prover needs to publish both _proof_ and _hash_.

Verifier can validate the hash:

```text
VRF_verify(public_key, message, proof)
```

If successful, `VRF_verify` will return _hash_.

VRFs have some interesting properties.

 * proof uniqueness - even when having ability to set _public key_ and _message_ the attacker cannot create two different proofs, for which call to VRF_verify returns success and returned hashes are different[^CBA].
 * collision resistance - even when having ability to select _secret key_ the adverary is not able to create two different messages, which would produce same hash[^CBA].
 * pseudorandomness (in the sense of [PRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_function_family))
 * random-oracle-like unpredictability - if the _message_ cannot be predicted then the hash is indistinguishable from uniform - this property is used in Symbol, I will get back to that in last part.

There is Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), that is working on standarizing VRF with various parameters.
Construction is very generic, one of the reasons is that there are multiple public-key cryptosystems that can be used.
Two biggest "groups" are:
 * RSA based VRFs, and
 * elliptic curve based VRFs

Here, I will focus only on EC-based variant, as that is what we use in Symbol.

## EC-VRF

I'll try not to go into details.

Both prover and verifier know:
 * `B` - ed25519 base point
 * prover's public key - `Y = x*B` (or will refer to Y simply as _public key_)
 * `H` - point on an elliptic curve derived from prover's _public key_ and _message_

Prover knows secret `x` (secret scalar derived from his secret key) and calculates:
 1. `Gamma = x*H` - since _H_ is a point and _x_ is a scalar, _Gamma_ is also a point
 2. `k` - nonce (random value) derived using hash function from secret key and _H_ (therefore konwn only to prover)
 3. `c` - magic coefficient derived from _Gamma_, `k*B` and `k*H` - also called "verification hash"
 4. `s = (k + c*x) mod q` - "s" for scalar

 The proof is a triplet: _(Gamma, c, s)_

 Last part, might look easy, however:
  * `q` is a prime number (>250 bits prime)
  * calculating `x` out of _Gamma_ would require solving [DLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) on elliptic curve
  * finding out value of `k` is equivalent to finding pre-image of used hash function

Therefore proof cannot be forged without knowledge of `x`.

After proof is calculated, `VRF_hashing()` is basically hashing a _Gamma_ part of a proof triplet.

Now more interesting part - the verifier. There are some tech peculiarities, but ultimately, verifier gets triplet _(Gamma, c, s)_
and calculates:

 1. `U = s*B - c*Y` = `(k*B + c*x*B) - c*Y` = `(k*B + c*Y) - c*Y` = `k*B`
 2. `V = s*H - c*Gamma` = `(k*H + c*x*H) - c*Gamma` = `(k*H + c*Gamma) - c*Gamma` = `k*H`

Now verifier has _Gamma_, `k*B` and `k*H`, therefore verifier can calculate `c'` the same way that prover calculates `c`.

If _c'_ matches _c_ provided in a proof, proof is valid and verifier can calculate VRF hash by running `VRF_hashing` on whole proof.

Note: all of this _might_ look a bit like a high school math, in reality however things are _slightly_ bit more complicated.
Part of the calculations happen on elliptic curve and part in a finite field.

# VRF in Symbol

I've skimmed a bit over some details, but I can't continue without them.

`H` in previous section is calculated using `ECVRF_hash_to_curve` function. _Hash to curve_[^h2c] is important part of crypto, and I don't
think it's an overstatement if I say that it has become a discipline of its own (especially in the world of ZK-crypto).

Currently symbol uses so called `ECVRF_hash_to_curve_try_and_increment` method, however, the implementation currently used is based on previous
version of a draft (v6) and is missing additional zero byte. We will address that in near future.

Full name of the VRF implementation used in Symbol is `ECVRF-EDWARDS25519-SHA512-TAI` (TAI comes from _try and increment_)

## How is VRF used?

Every harvester in Symbol has associated VRF public key (using [vrf key link transaction](https://docs.symbolplatform.com/serialization/index.html#vrfkeylinktransaction)).

Half of a VRF hash (hashed _Gamma_) is used as what we call _generation hash_. As mentioned earlier, VRF hash can act like random-oracle **if** _message_ is unpredictable.<br>
In case of Symbol, _message_ passed to VRF calculation is [generation hash of a previous block](https://github.com/symbol/catapult-client/blob/55a79871de6ca36cb6aa74d9d41cbbbe1ab71935/extensions/harvesting/src/Harvester.cpp#L116).

```cpp
// Harvester.cpp
unlockedAccountsView.forEach([&context, &hitContext, &hitPredicate, &pHarvesterKeyPair, &vrfProof](const auto& descriptor) {
	hitContext.Signer = descriptor.signingKeyPair().publicKey();

	vrfProof = crypto::GenerateVrfProof(context.ParentContext.GenerationHash, descriptor.vrfKeyPair());
```

First [vrf proof was generated by nemesis account](https://github.com/symbol/catapult-client/blob/dev/tools/nemgen/BlockGenerator.cpp#L230-L231), _message_ passed to VRF calculation of the first block (genesis block) is called _generation hash seed_ it is specified via entry in `config-network.properties`.[^genhashtrivia]<br>

Without VRF (i.e. in NEM) and with perfect information, it is possible to guess who will be harvester of a next block - at height `H`.
If generation hash is dependent solely on harvester's public key, the attacker that could predict harvester of a block at height `H` could also calculate generation hash that block and then premine block at height `H+1`.

With VRF in place, it's no longer possible to predict harvester, because [_hit_ value depends on _generation hash_](https://github.com/symbol/catapult-client/blob/55a79871de6ca36cb6aa74d9d41cbbbe1ab71935/src/catapult/chain/BlockScorer.cpp#L76-L100).
