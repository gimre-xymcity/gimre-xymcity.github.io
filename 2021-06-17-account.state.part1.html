**Verifying Symbol account state proofs for fun and profit (part 1)**
But mostly for fun

Public network has magic feature called state proofs. I don't think this has been described with enough details or I don't think most users realize what this feature gives.

State proofs allow to PROVE to some third party, that at height X, your account state (or mosaic state, or namespace state, or any other state) was equal to Y.

There is one small catch here: right now there is no easy way to retrieve via APIs the state at **given** height, so assumption is the state was saved at proper height. Best part is, that such state can be validated by verifier in a trustless manner.

# Serializing state

What is inside the state? Short answer is: "probably too much". But let's dive in.

Let's take a look at following Symbol testnet account: `TAKUOCDJH4KUDYP7ZH5HMW43QXYXTLFEDQUR4MI`

![`TAKUOCDJH4KUDYP7ZH5HMW43QXYXTLFEDQUR4MI` account details as seen in testnet block explorer](2021-06-17-account.state.part1/01-explorer.png width=600)

Account details can be retrieved by querying REST API endpoint `/accounts/<account-id>`, at the time of writing this, the data returned looks like this:

```json
{
  "account": {
    "version": 1,
    "address": "98154708693F1541E1FFC9FA765B9B85F179ACA41C291E31",
    "addressHeight": "119481",
    "publicKey": "13182CF21C0C13BA3FB5401EEED94D274C4305A54017ABCA7CDDEB85A173F765",
    "publicKeyHeight": "119490",
    "accountType": 0,
    "supplementalPublicKeys": {},
    "activityBuckets": [],
    "mosaics": [
      {
        "id": "091F837E059AE13C",
        "amount": "8539426394"
      }
    ],
    "importance": "0",
    "importanceHeight": "0"
  },
  "id": "<node-based, not important>"
}
```

Currently symbol python core-sdk, does not allow to serialize account state, but account state has it’s definition inside [catbuffer-schemas](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer-schemas). So let’s do pretty ugly, manual serialization of the data above.

The account above has importance = 0, which means this is not a high-value accounts, which makes things much easier.

![serializing account state like there’s no tomorrow](2021-06-17-account.state.part1/02-serialize.png width=600)

Last thing needed before verifying account state, is to calculate sha3 hash of the serialized data

```
010098154708693f1541e1ffc9fa765b9b85f179aca41c291e31b9d201000000
000013182cf21c0c13ba3fb5401eeed94d274c4305a54017abca7cddeb85a173
f765c2d20100000000000000000001003ce19a057e831f095a4efdfc01000000
```

Resulting account state sha3 hash is: `9532475d9217848ca629e690c89470f18c95497d8913233e74fa32b802b3c5d5`

It will be verified later.

# Verifying state tree

There’s a pretty detailed description of merkle trees in [chapter 4 in catapult-whitepaper](https://docs.symbolplatform.com/symbol-technicalref/main.pdf), so I’m not gonna repeat that here.

Let’s query current merkle tree path of that account. The REST API endpoint for this is `/accounts/<account-id>/merkle`, returned data looks like following:

![merkle path of account in question](2021-06-17-account.state.part1/03-merkle1.png width=600)

REST API returns the tree both in “raw” format — which needs parsing and in “parsed” format which is easier to process.

Returned merkle tree path is from the top of the tree to the bottom (leaf). The verification can be in either direction — either from bottom to the top, or from top to the bottom.

When visualized, the tree will look like so (I deliberately shortened the links==hashes . This is full tree, so missing links are exchanged with 00-hashes)

![Full merkle tree path visualized](2021-06-17-account.state.part1/04-merkle2.png width=600)

Let’s start with a path. Path is simply hash of a key. In case of account state cache, key is simply account address. So in case of account `TAKUOCDJH4KUDYP7ZH5HMW43QXYXTLFEDQUR4MI` the path is:

```python
>>> sha3_256(unhexlify('98154708693F1541E1FFC9FA765B9B85F179ACA41C291E31')).hexdigest()
```none output
E220E4E4BCF533F0E0082F28E65B8EA5A278D255DB22D61D097A2F9008676F3A
```

Every branch in a tree might contain non-empty `path`, but in example above it’s always empty, so going from the top to the bottom, proper nibbles[^nibble] from account path must be taken.
In order: `E`, `2`, `2`, `0`, so “leftover” path is `E4E4BCF533F0E0082F28E65B8EA5A278D255DB22D61D097A2F9008676F3A`

!!!
    Note: if it’s not possible to traverse the tree from the top to the bottom using proper branches, it means tree has been manipulated.

Now, it’s easy to notice that the leaf (`"type": 255`) value is equal to sha3 hash calculated previously, yay! one check done.

```json
{
  "type": 255,
  "path": "E4E4BCF533F0E0082F28E65B8EA5A278D255DB22D61D097A2F9008676F3A",
  "encodedPath": "20E4E4BCF533F0E0082F28E65B8EA5A278D255DB22D61D097A2F9008676F3A",
  "nibbleCount": 60,
  "value": "9532475D9217848CA629E690C89470F18C95497D8913233E74FA32B802B3C5D5",
  "leafHash": "39D61E874BE3A301D1FEE4DDA1D2F6D53030004A51E6399BFB6F58EE35218EC4"
}
```

Now, what verifier needs to do is to check all the hashes on the way. Let’s start from the bottom as it will be easier.

`leafHash` is a hash of concatenated encodedPath[^encodedPath] and value, so:

```python
>>> sha3_256(unhexlify('20E4E4BCF533F0E0082F28E65B8EA5A278D255DB22D61D097A2F9008676F3A') + unhexlify('9532475D9217848CA629E690C89470F18C95497D8913233E74FA32B802B3C5D5')).hexdigest()
```none output
39D61E874BE3A301D1FEE4DDA1D2F6D53030004A51E6399BFB6F58EE35218EC4
```

Yay! It matches.

Path nibble that took us to this leaf had value 0. That means that “link” at 0th element at level 4 must equal to that hash and indeed it does.

In a similar fashion, `branchHash` — is hash of concatened `encodedPath` and all the links at given level. As noted earlier missing elements must be filled with `00`-hash. So for level 4, `encodedPath` is equal to ‘00’ and that gives us:

```python
>>> zero = unhexlify('00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000')
>>> sha3_256(unhexlify('00') + u('39D61E874BE3A301D1FEE4DDA1D2F6D53030004A51E6399BFB6F58EE35218EC4') + zero * 3 + unhexlify('6A69ADA0538FC9582D813619288B400038286522206FEA14D231F0D9775900E3') + zero * 11).hexdigest()
```none output
B1508023DFF34155479B81C93EE43926F590E59E0CEA66F4633D5929B809AC34
```

And you can check that this matches `branchHash` at level 4.

Path nibble that leaded here was `2` and link at level 3 at position 2, matches calculated hash.

Now we need to tediously repeat the process, I’ll just paste links that calculate proper branchHashes:

Finally, prover can check, that the calculated hash matches state tree hash at that concrete height, for which merkle tree path was obtained:

http://explorer.testnet.symboldev.network/blocks/173056

![Block explorer information for block at height 173056](2021-06-17-account.state.part1/05-explorer.block.png width=600)

Now, I took a **shortcut** and referenced block explorer, but to do this fully trustlessly, the verifier should gather all block headers — only headers,
no need to actually verify their contents — check that they form a chain, and then can validate that account state hash in that block actually matches computed one.

That last part could be optimized, by checking only blocks at multiples of finalization epoch.

# Summary:

Prover provides:

 * account state
 * merkle tree path at given height

Verifier:

 * serializes account state,
 * validates serialized state against merkle tree path
 * validates state root hash against block header

The title is blatant reference to [(in)famous 25 years old article](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html).
